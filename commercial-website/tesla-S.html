                     <p>Model S was codenamed WhiteStar before its release. It was officially announced on June 30, 2008. The prototype vehicle was displayed on March 26, 2009. The exclusive premier was held at Tesla's Menlo Park store on April 8, 2009.</p>

                     <p>First production Model S, with owner and Tesla board member Steve Jurvetson. In May 2010 Tesla announced it would produce the Model S at the former NUMMI plant in Fremont, California, which became known as the Tesla Factory.</p>

                     <p>In 2012, the EPA range for the base model was 208 mi (335 km) while the longer range model was 265 miles (426 km). Musk claimed that the Model S battery offered twice the energy density of the Nissan Leaf's, with more than double the range, increased by a low drag coefficient, motor efficiency and rolling resistance. The original battery was similar to the Panasonic NCR18650B cell that offered an energy density of 265 Wh/kg. Analysts estimated battery costs to be around 21â€“22% of the car cost. The 60 kWh battery was guaranteed for eight years or 125,000 miles (200,000 km), while the 85 kWh was guaranteed for eight years and unlimited miles.In 2012, Tesla began building a network of 480-volt charging stations, called Tesla Superchargers, to facilitate long-distance travel.</p>

                     <p>The Tesla Model S was the 2013 World Green Car of the Year, 2013 Motor Trend Car of the Year, Automobile magazine's 2013 Car of the Year, Time Magazine's Best 25 Inventions of the Year 2012, and Consumer Reports' top-scoring car in road testing. In 2015, Car and Driver named the Model S the Car of the Century. After not recommending the Model S in 2015 due to poor reliability, one year later, Consumer Reports added the car to its recommended list.</p>

                     <p>On October 9, 2014, Tesla introduced "Dual Drive" all-wheel drive (AWD) versions of the Model S 60, 85, and P85 models, designated by a D at the end of the model number (the P represented performance). Autopilot arrived in September 2014, supported by cameras, forward looking radar and ultrasonic acoustic location sensors that provided a 360-degree view.</p>

                     <p>In June 2015, Tesla said that Model S cars had traveled over 1 billion miles (1.6 billion km), the first all-electric car to reach that total. (In 2014 the hybrid-electric Chevy Volt had travelled 1 billion miles, but only 629 million were all-electric miles, while Nissan said the all-electric Leaf had accumulated 625 million total miles.) Global Model S sales passed 100,000 units in 2015, and 150,000 in November 2016. The 200,000 milestone was achieved by early in the fourth quarter of 2017.</p>

                     <p>In 2015, Tesla introduced a 70 kWh battery to replace the existing 60 kWh batteries and base 60 kWh Model S vehicles. It introduced a 90 kWh battery as a "range upgrade" and explained that the 6% energy increase was due to "improved cell chemistry" and the introduction of silicon into the cell's graphite anode. The 60 and 60D returned in 2016 with a software-limited, upgradeable 75 kWH battery and the "Bioweapon Defense Mode" air filter.</p>

                     <p>In April 2017, Tesla ceased offering the 60 kWh software-limited battery option. The lowest-capacity option became the 75 kWh, and at the same time Tesla significantly reduced the software upgrade options for facelifted 60 and 70 models to be upgraded over-the-air to 75 (and rebadged at their next visit to a Tesla service center). In August 2017, Tesla announced that HW2.5 included a secondary processor node to provide more computing power and additional wiring redundancy to improve reliability; it also enabled dashcam and sentry mode capabilities. By 2017, in the Consumer Reports Car Reliability Survey, Tesla's position on the list had moved up four spots; the predicted reliability rating for Model S reached "above average" for the first time.</p>

                     <p>In March 2018 it was announced that Tesla had upgraded the Media Control Unit (MCU) to version 2. MCU 2 improved the performance of the center screen, enabling Tesla Arcade and Tesla Theater. The center display and the instrument cluster were driven by a single multi-core x86 Intel Atom CPU. In May 2018 Tesla released incomplete source code for the Model S on a GitHub repository as part of their software license compliance process in collaboration with the Software Freedom Conservancy.</p>

                     <p>As of March 2020, Tesla operated 16,103 superchargers in 1,826 stations worldwide; these include 908 stations in the U.S., 98 in Canada, 16 in Mexico, 520 in Europe, and 398 in the Asia/Pacific region. In August 2020 the range test results were updated by the EPA to 402 miles (647 km), higher than that of any other battery electric car. Tesla warranties finally specified a 70% battery loss limit.</p>

                     <p>In 2021, Tesla dropped the Performance and Ludicrous branding from its new lineup in favor of the new Plaid branding. On June 10, 2021, the Model S Plaid was released at a delivery event at the factory.</p>
